Website for the game 'Cards for Humanity'

'Cards for Humanity' is the game developed by group of students during BIT minor "Serious gaming" at University of Twente.
The game is about United Nation goals, so the website about broad information about UN goals was needed.
The website contains information about each of UN goals, description of UN organizations and branches,
donation links and information about the game itself.
